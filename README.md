# Foreign-Alphabet
Learning tool for learning Foreign Alphabets and Syllabaries

## Who this application is for
This program is for people who are beginners to learn a foreign language and want to learn a new Alphabet like Cyrillic or Syllabary like Japanese Hiragana.
This program is meant to be used in conjunction with other learning tools. It’s designed as a way to practice new alphabets, rather than learning characters from scratch.
For learning Japanese kana, I recommend https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/ as this was inspiration for this project.
## What this application does
This program will display one character at a time from a chosen alphabet or syllabary (or subset of that alphabet)
Just load one of the XML files that we include (or create your own)
and select which characters you want to display.
The best way to learn a new alphabet is to try and recall its sounds from memory.
This program will display a random character, once you recall the sound of this character, you can press next to display the next character.
If you cannot recall it's sound, you can display its Latin and IPA form.
However, recommend you don’t do this often, as recalling the character is the only way you will learn the character.
So keep struggling and try and remember.
## What Alphabets are included
Included is xml files for Hiragana
With audio for none at the moment

In the very near future you will see Katakana, Cyrillic, and Swedish with audio for all of them.
In the farther future I plan to create more xml files for more languages and record more audio.

You can even create your own files, you only need to have very basic xml knowledge, you can use one of the provided files as a template.
