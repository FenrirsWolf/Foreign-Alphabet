# Foreign-Alphabet
Learning tool for learning Foreign Alphabets and Syllabaries<br>
This program is still a work in progress; however, all releases are a very usable state, and I am actively developing this program

## Who this application is for
This program is for people who are beginners to learn a foreign language and want to learn a new Alphabet or Syllabary like Japanese Hiragana, Katakana.
This program is meant to be used in conjunction with other learning tools.

It’s designed as a way to practice new alphabets, rather than learning characters from scratch.
For learning Japanese kana, I recommend https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/learn-hiragana/ as this was inspiration for this project.
## What this application does
This program will display one character at a time from a chosen alphabet or syllabary (or subset of that alphabet)
Just load one of the XML files that we include (or create your own)
and select which characters you want to display.
The best way to learn a new alphabet is to try and recall its sounds from memory.
This program will display a random character, and you will type the meaning or reading (selectable)
If you cannot recall it's reading / meaning, you can display it.
However, only do this if you’re really stuck, as recalling the character from memory is the only way you will learn the character.
It's much better to struggle a little longer and really try and remember.
## What Alphabets are included
Included is alphabet files for Japanese Kana (Hiragana and Katakana) and some basic Kanji (WIP)

In the future I will add more Kanji and will explore option for more languages.

You can even create your own files, you only need to have very basic xml knowledge, you can use one of the provided files as a template, though it is a little time consuming, and I am likely to change the way the files work in the future.
